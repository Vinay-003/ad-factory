"""
Assembler-only ad prompt generator.

What this script does:
  - Reads externally-generated ad copy from a JSON file (no copy generation here).
  - Selects catalog background slots with exhaustive per-format rotation.
  - Builds seeded background sentence from `background_variant.json`.
  - Assembles full 9-section prompts per playbook and writes `output/vN/OUTPUT_<FORMAT>_(EN|HI).txt`.
  - Enforces safe-zone rules by embedding an explicit SAFE-ZONE ENFORCEMENT block.
  - Appends entries to `AD_GENERATION_REGISTRY.JSON` and updates indexes (background rotation + used_text).

What this script explicitly does NOT do:
  - It does not call any LLM.
  - It does not invent persona fields or ad copy.
  - It does not “freshen” text; freshness is enforced by strict uniqueness checks against registry.
