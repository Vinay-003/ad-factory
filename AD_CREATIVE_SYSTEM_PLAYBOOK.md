# Obesity Killer Ad Creative System Playbook
# Version 2.0 — Revised with full prompt system, background variation engine, and live registry logic

---

## 0) Quick Start (Read First)

How to use this playbook in chat:
- If user gives no specific inputs (persona/headline/format), generate a default starter batch immediately.
- If user gives specific inputs (persona and/or headline and/or format), use those inputs first.
- If user gives partial inputs, use what they gave and fill missing fields with defaults from this playbook.
- Always keep claims restricted to `productinfomain.txt` and preserve product fidelity rules.

Execution mode lock (important):
- This repo uses the custom in-repo playbook + scripts workflow as primary execution path.
- Do not switch to the generic `ad-factory` skill flow unless the user explicitly asks to use that skill.
- Treat "refer to playbook md and create ads" as the same as "create ads".
- For `create ads` requests, execute directly and return outputs; do not run exploratory commentary.

Accepted user input styles (examples):
- "Create ads" -> generate default starter batch (all 5 formats, 1 variation each)
- "Persona 9, HERO + TEST" -> use persona 9 for those formats
- "Use this headline: ... for FEAT" -> keep that headline, generate rest as needed
- "UGC only" -> generate only UGC with default persona/headline mode unless user specifies
- "Create 9:16 ads" / "Stories ads" / "Reels ads" -> switch output sizing and text placement to 9:16 safe-zone rules before prompt finalization

Default starter batch profile (use when no specific input is given):
- Persona selection: random from 1-22 per format (do not use a fixed mapping)
- Prefer unique personas across selected formats in the same batch when possible
- If user provides persona for only some formats, keep those fixed and randomize remaining formats
- Headline mode: AI-generated fresh headlines
- Default canvas mode when user gives no placement/ratio instruction: 4:5
- Formats: HERO, BA, TEST, FEAT, UGC

---

## 1) Objective

Generate high-converting static ads for Obesity Killer Kit across 5 formats:
- HERO
- BA (Before/After journey style)
- TEST (Testimonial)
- FEAT (Features/benefits)
- UGC (Creator-style)

Current production mode:
- Generate 1 variation per format.
- Log every generation to registry immediately after output finalization.

---

## 2) Source of Truth (Do not invent)

Use only approved claims and context from `productinfomain.txt`.
Use `PRODUCT_MECHANISM_V1.txt` as the mechanism-model file derived from `productinfomain.txt`.

Persona language source:
- Use `PERSONA_DEEP_DIVE_01_05.txt` as the active bridge file for persona-specific ad language.
- This file adds: raw pain lines, trigger scenarios, objections, language bank, mechanism match, and trust anchors.
- Operational generation mode is L1+L2 only: use Layer 1 (Raw Persona Truth) + Layer 2 (Message Strategy) as the copy source.
- When a covered persona is selected, pull wording and proof angles from Layer 1 and Layer 2 before writing headlines, captions, hooks, or testimonial-style language.
- Do not invent generic persona language when a deep-dive entry already exists.
- Current coverage in the deep-dive file: personas 1-22.

Mechanism grounding rules:
- Use `productinfomain.txt`, `faq.txt`, and `PRODUCT_MECHANISM_V1.txt` together.
- `productinfomain.txt` is the source for approved claims, mechanism boundaries, support details, and offer details.
- `faq.txt` is the source for protocol details, Q&A handling, and usage caveats.
- `PRODUCT_MECHANISM_V1.txt` is the source for simplified mechanism framing and behavior-change mapping.
- Only use mechanism logic defined in `PRODUCT_MECHANISM_V1.txt`.
- Do not invent new benefit logic outside that file.
- Do not frame the product as a fat burner.
- Do not use claims like `boosts metabolism`, `burns fat fast`, `accelerates fat loss`, or similar shortcuts.
- Product logic must stay grounded in: reduced hunger, reduced cravings, reduced random eating, reduced intake, and digestion support.
- Support lines must not stop at generic routine language; they must connect the approved mechanism to the product's weight-management purpose.
- Every support line should ladder up from mechanism to outcome using compliant phrasing such as: supports weight loss efforts, helps reduce overeating that drives weight gain, supports reducing excess weight, supports obesity reduction efforts, or helps make weight reduction more manageable.
- Do not write support lines that only mention routine simplicity, clarity, consistency, mindset, or guidance unless they also make clear that the product is for reducing excess weight / obesity.

Approved anchors:
- 3-5 kg average in 15 days
- Ayurvedic kit, natural ingredients
- Cravings/hunger control support
- Digestion/metabolism support
- No crash diets, no heavy workouts
- Trusted by 70,000+ users
- Money-back terms apply

Never add unsupported medical claims, disease cures, or made-up mechanisms.

---

## 3) Product Fidelity Lock (Mandatory — applies to every single output)

Image source:
- Primary production path: pass product reference image URLs from `input/activeimages.txt` into Kie Nano Banana API (`image_input`).
- Prompt requirement (always include): "Use the uploaded Obesity Killer product packshot images as absolute visual truth."
- Optional manual path (prompt-only workflow): if user runs prompts directly in Gemini/Web tools, use the same 6 reference packshots as visual truth.
- Never ask the user to re-describe products — the images are the reference.

Product dimensions (use for correct relative sizing in every image):

- OK Kit Box — Cuboid — 20.3 x 10.1 x 14.8 cm (largest element, acts as anchor)
- OK Powder Bottle — Cylinder — Diameter 5 cm, Height 10 cm
- OK Tablet Bottle — Cylinder — Diameter 3 cm, Height 5 cm
- Amla Bottle — Cylinder — Diameter 3 cm, Height 5 cm
- OK Liquid Sachet — Vertical Rectangle — Width 10 cm, Height 15.3 cm (tall and narrow)

All 5 products must appear in every output. Size them in correct proportion based on dimensions above.

Exact label text — render these perfectly on every product:

- Kit Box: Top strip — "Panacea for weight loss and obesity related conditions" / Logo — "Dr. ARUN TYAGI'S" in red + "OBESITY KILLER KIT" in black / Badge — "ISO 9001:2008 Certified"
- Amla Bottle (red cap, far left): "Dried Amla" — retain amla fruit illustration sharp
- OK Tablets Bottle: "OK TABLETS"
- OKP Bottle: "OKP" — retain light pattern on label
- OK Liquid Sachet (green, far right): "OK LIQUID" — retain sharp lotus logo above text

Product fidelity rules:
- Do not redesign, redraw, relabel, or recreate any product or packaging
- Do not change brand name, label colors, illustrations, or proportions
- Do not blur, approximate, paraphrase, or "fix" any text (Hindi or English)
- Do not replace unclear text with guesses — preserve the original image as-is
- Only permitted: placement, scaling, subtle drop shadows, mild lighting correction
- If uncertain about any detail — simplify the background, keep the product unchanged

---

## 4) Brand and Writing Rules

From `productinfomain.txt`:
- Tone: empathetic coach, trustworthy, uplifting
- Style: simple language, active voice, short sentences, no filler
- Credibility: specifics over vague adjectives
- Function over form
- Correctness over hype

Headline and caption must be clear, readable, and useful.

On-image copy realism rules (anti-AI style):
- Write headlines like real Indian performance ads: plain language, sentence case, natural rhythm.
- Do not use decorative symbols in headline/support/CTA: `*`, `-`, `_`, `|`, `~`, `#`, `@`, `/`, `\\`.
- Allowed punctuation on-image is minimal: `.`, `,`, `?`, apostrophe. Use only when naturally needed.
- No emoji, no hashtag-style copy, no forced separators, no bracketed gimmicks.
- Avoid all-caps headlines unless acronym is part of product label.
- Keep headline human-sounding, not template-looking: avoid stacked fragments and slogan-like punctuation tricks.
- No disclaimer line on-image by default. Do not add disclaimer text blocks in headline/support/CTA area.

---

## 5) Color Palette — Strict, No Exceptions

Background: #FFFBED to #FEEFD6 to #FCDBAC — smooth top-to-bottom gradient only
Accents and CTA: #F79040 to #E66410
Headlines: #973015
Body text and bullets: #421808
No colors outside this palette. No neon. No harsh gradients. No random accent colors anywhere.

---

## 6) Persona System

Use one primary persona per creative.

Persona library (select by number):
1. Craving-Control Struggler
2. Busy Professional
3. Emotional Eater / Stress Snacker
4. Plateau Victim
5. PCOD Support Seeker (no cure claims)
6. Thyroid Weight-Gain Struggler (no cure claims)
7. Post-Failure Re-starter (many failed diets)
8. No-Weakness Skeptic
9. Time-Starved Parent
10. Homemaker, self-care deprioritized
11. Office Snacker (tea-time/junk cycle)
12. Late-Night Eater
13. Festive/Travel Weight Regainer
14. Metabolism-Worry Buyer
15. Digestion-Issue + Weight Combo Seeker
16. Budget-Conscious Result Seeker
17. Wedding/Event Deadline Persona
18. Confidence-First Persona (appearance + energy)
19. Trust-First Buyer (doctor-backed only)
20. Support-Dependent Persona (needs accountability)
21. Beginner Who Hates Complex Plans
22. 35+ Slow-Progress Persona

For each persona, define these 5 fields before writing copy:
- Pain: what hurts now
- Desire: dream outcome
- Friction: why they failed before
- Proof needed: what makes them believe
- Tone cue: how the voice should feel

Deep-dive expansion rule:
- If the selected persona exists in `PERSONA_DEEP_DIVE_01_05.txt`, treat that file as the working persona brief.
- Pull ad inputs from these blocks when present: Pain Points, Trigger Scenarios, Objections, Language Bank, Mechanism Match, Trust Anchors.
- Use the exact natural phrasing style from the deep-dive file to avoid generic copy.
- Mechanism lines must explain the product in simple relatable terms, not abstract health language.
- Trust angles must match the persona-specific proof preferences from the deep-dive file.

L1+L2 rendering workflow (mandatory):
- Step 1: Read Layer 1 - Raw Persona Truth to understand how the person actually thinks and speaks.
- Step 2: Read `productinfomain.txt` for approved claims and product boundaries.
- Step 2b: Read `faq.txt` for protocol details, restrictions, and edge-case usage rules.
- Step 3: Read `PRODUCT_MECHANISM_V1.txt` to lock the allowed product behavior.
- Step 4: Read Layer 2 - Message Strategy to choose the right pain angle, mechanism angle, and trust angle.
- Step 5: Compose all final ad copy freshly from Layer 1 + Layer 2 only in the requested language.
- Do not translate raw Hinglish lines word-for-word into ad copy. Use them to understand emotion first, then render cleanly in the target language.
- Keep the underlying pain, mechanism, and trust angle consistent across all language outputs.
- When using persona mechanism sections, map the persona's eating behavior to the product's approved behavior change from `PRODUCT_MECHANISM_V1.txt`.
- When protocol-specific details are needed, such as timing, fasting window, support, restrictions, or usage caveats, pull them from `faq.txt` rather than inventing them.

Fresh composition rule (mandatory):
- Every headline/support/CTA/bullet must be freshly composed from Layer 1 + Layer 2 strategy.
- Keep mechanism truth constant, but vary sentence rhythm, opening pattern, and proof framing.
- In one batch, avoid repeating the same opening pattern across formats (for example, repeated "When...", "If...", "No..." starts).
- Scale rule for high-volume production: rotate at least one major copy axis per ad (hook structure, proof style, sacrifice framing, or CTA voice), while keeping claims compliant.

Selection rule:
- Use one primary persona plus one optional secondary micro-context.
- Example: Primary = Busy Professional, Secondary = Late-Night Eater.

---

## 7) Headline Engine

Each headline must do 2 jobs:
1. Scroll stop with persona pain
2. Show how Obesity Killer solves that pain using an approved mechanism

Formula: Hook (pain) + Mechanism (how) + Outcome/time

Freshness rule:
- Do not use a fixed headline bank as final output.
- Generate new headlines every request from persona pain + mechanism + outcome.
- Avoid repeating opening patterns across consecutive ads.
- Rotate angle each time: pain, objection, mechanism, time, proof, sacrifice reduction.

Examples (direction only, do not copy-paste):
- "Cravings control nahi ho rahe? 15 din mein routine palat sakta hai."
- "Time nahi hai gym ka? Weight routine fir bhi possible hai."
- "Weight loss chahiye, weakness nahi."

---

## 8) Caption Engine (Value Equation)

Use this equation in every caption:
Value = (Dream Outcome x Likelihood of Achievement) / (Time Delay x Sacrifice)

Move each component:
- Dream Outcome: visible loss + lighter body + confidence
- Likelihood: doctor credibility, 70,000+ users, clear daily protocol, support
- Time Delay: 15-day milestone language
- Sacrifice: no crash diet, no heavy workout, practical routine

Caption checklist:
- 1-2 short lines
- Concrete benefit
- Concrete mechanism
- Low-sacrifice framing
- No disclaimer sentence in on-image copy

Fresh caption rule: generate fresh each run, keep meaning stable, vary phrasing and angle.

---

## 9) Background Variation Engine (NEW)

Goal: Every ad generation session must use a distinctly different background/scene setting so no two outputs look the same.

Background files and purpose:
- `BACKGROUND_VARIANTS.JSON` = master slot catalog (ID, title, format eligibility)
- `background_variant.json` = safe-zone enriched structured descriptors used for seeded scene sentence generation

Background hygiene rule (mandatory):
- Avoid workstation-heavy props by default (keyboard, laptop, monitor, mouse, dense office clutter), unless user explicitly requests office-device context.
- Prefer clean lifestyle props (cup, book, towel, tray, plant) with low visual noise.
- FEAT default pool preference: avoid desk/workstation scenes entirely; prioritize clean studio, shelf, tray, kitchen, or clinical-minimal contexts.

### How it works:

Before generating any prompt, the assistant must:
1. Check `AD_GENERATION_REGISTRY.JSON` slot usage for the selected format.
2. Build allowed catalog pool from `BACKGROUND_VARIANTS.JSON` where `formats` contains the selected format.
3. Select only from slots not yet used in current cycle for that format (`indexes.slot_exhaustion_tracker.<FORMAT>.remaining_slots_current_cycle`).
4. Generate a seeded scene sentence with `scripts/upgrade_safezone_backgrounds.py` using the same slot ID.
5. Include both slot ID and seeded sentence in Section 8 (VISUAL DIRECTION BLOCK), then log slot + seed in registry.
6. When remaining pool becomes empty, reset cycle for that format and continue.

### Selection rules:

- Exhaustive rotation is mandatory for catalog slots: no slot may repeat for a format until all allowed slots for that format are used once.
- If registry is empty or tracker missing: initialize cycle with full allowed pool for that format and pick one.
- ID format is three digits (`BG-001` ... `BG-500`).

### Background selection algorithm (mandatory)

- Use catalog-first selection from `BACKGROUND_VARIANTS.JSON` and enforce exhaustive rotation using `indexes.slot_exhaustion_tracker`.
- Select from `remaining_slots_current_cycle`, then move selected slot to `used_slots_current_cycle`.
- If `remaining_slots_current_cycle` is empty, increment cycle number and repopulate from current allowed pool.
- Safe-zone sentence generation must use:
  - `python3 scripts/upgrade_safezone_backgrounds.py --prompt-only --id BG-XXX --format 4:5 --seed <SEED>`
- Mandatory script execution note:
  - Do not simulate this command. Run it and use the real stdout sentence.
  - If command fails, stop prompt finalization, surface stderr, and retry only after fixing the failure.
- SEED rule: `SEED = (BATCH_NUMBER * 1000) + (PERSONA_NUMBER * 10) + VARIATION`
- Include in Section 8:
  - `Background slot: BG-XXX`
  - `Seed: <SEED>`
  - Full seeded sentence output
  - Safe-zone fields: `composition`, `layout_intent`, `cta_safe_space`, `crop_safety`

---

## 10) Registry System

Registry file: `AD_GENERATION_REGISTRY.JSON`

### Current mode: PRODUCTION — registry read enabled, `mode.write_enabled: true`.

In production mode:
- Read registry to check what has been used recently (avoid repeating).
- Write one entry per generation immediately after final output.
- Never overwrite history; append-only logging.

### Registry schema (current production structure):

```json
{
  "mode": {
    "phase": "production",
    "write_enabled": true,
    "last_updated": "2026-04-18T09:51:00Z"

    }
  }
}
```

### Fields to log for every entry:

- id: sequential entry ID (entry_001, entry_002, etc.)
- timestamp: ISO 8601 format
- format: HERO / BA / TEST / FEAT / UGC
- persona_number: 1-22
- persona_name: readable name
- headline_angle: pain / objection / mechanism / time / proof / sacrifice_reduction
- headline_en: exact English headline used
- headline_hi: exact Hindi headline used
- support_line_en/support_line_hi: exact support line used on image
- cta_en/cta_hi: exact CTA used on image
- caption_en/caption_hi: exact long-form caption used (if any)
- bullets_en/bullets_hi: exact bullet text array used (if any)
- background_slot: BG-001 through BG-500 (or fresh-generated background signature)
- background_name: readable name of slot
- background_source: catalog / fresh
- fresh_background_signature: required when source is fresh, else null
- opening_pattern_4tok_en/opening_pattern_4tok_hi: first 4-token normalized opening pattern of headline
- copy_skeleton: high-level copy structure tag (for example: pain_mechanism_time)
- hook_structure_class: hook composition class (question_lead / contrast_loop / command_lead / confession_lead / proof_lead)
- proof_style_class: trust framing class (social_proof / mechanism_explainer / authority_anchor / routine_clarity / objection_flip)
- cta_voice_class: CTA intent class (urgent_start / guided_next_step / reassurance_start / challenge_action / discovery_action)
- language: EN / HI / BOTH
- output_quality: approved / rejected / pending
- notes: optional free text

### Deduplication rules (apply in production):

- Same persona + same format = flag if used in last 3 entries for that format. Suggest switching persona or angle.
- Catalog background dedupe = exhaustive rotation hard block by format until cycle exhaustion reset.
- Same fresh_background_signature + same format = hard block if used in last 20 entries for that format.
- Same headline_angle + same format = flag if used in last 3 entries. Rotate angle.
- Same persona + same headline_angle = hard block regardless of format. Always change at least one.
- Any exact text reuse is forbidden across all history: headline, support line, CTA, caption, and bullets in both EN and HI must be new every time.
- Same opening_pattern_4tok + same format/language = hard block in recent window (last 10 entries).
- Same copy_skeleton + same format/language = hard block if repeated in last 5 entries.
- Same hook_structure_class + proof_style_class + cta_voice_class trio = hard block in last 12 entries (prevents "same ad with new words" effect).

### Copy diversity matrix (mandatory for scaled production)

Every ad must be tagged before finalization using these 4 axes and rotated intentionally across a batch.

- hook_structure_class:
  - `question_lead`
  - `contrast_loop`
  - `command_lead`
  - `confession_lead`
  - `proof_lead`
- proof_style_class:
  - `social_proof`
  - `mechanism_explainer`
  - `authority_anchor`
  - `routine_clarity`
  - `objection_flip`
- cta_voice_class:
  - `urgent_start`
  - `guided_next_step`
  - `reassurance_start`
  - `challenge_action`
  - `discovery_action`
- copy_skeleton (examples):
  - `pain_mechanism_time`
  - `objection_flip_mechanism`
  - `proof_then_routine`
  - `micro_story_then_action`
  - `problem_reframe_then_next_step`

Batch diversity minimum:
- In any 5-ad batch, at least 4 unique `hook_structure_class` values.
- In any 5-ad batch, at least 3 unique `cta_voice_class` values.
- No repeated `copy_skeleton` within the same batch.

### Heading uniqueness rules (mandatory)

1) Fresh composition source
- Generate all headline/support/CTA copy from Persona Layer 1 + Layer 2 only.
- Do not reuse any prior output sentence.
- Do not paraphrase old lines from previous batches.

2) Same-persona multi-format separation
- If one persona is used across HERO, BA, TEST, FEAT, UGC in the same batch, each format must use a different sub-angle:
  - HERO: strongest pain contrast
  - BA: before to after transition from one specific trigger
  - TEST: objection to belief shift
  - FEAT: mechanism breakdown on a different trigger
  - UGC: first-person micro-moment

3) Motif non-repetition (hard block)
- Do not repeat the same 2-4 word motif across formats in the same batch.
- Examples of banned repeats in one batch: `night loop`, `undoes your day`, `late-night cravings`.
- If overlap appears, regenerate lower-priority format copy.

4) Structural uniqueness
- Opening pattern must differ across formats.
- Reject if first 4-token pattern repeats in same persona batch.
- Reject if same copy skeleton repeats (example: question to mechanism to CTA).

5) Headline angle rotation
- Rotate headline angle each time: pain, objection, mechanism, proof, time, sacrifice reduction.
- Same persona plus same angle in adjacent runs is not allowed.

6) Lexical distance check
- Headline must use substantially different core nouns/verbs from other formats in same persona batch.
- Synonym swaps alone are not accepted as new.

7) Language purity
- EN files: fully English on-image copy.
- HI files: Hindi-first unless Hinglish is explicitly requested.
- Reject mixed-language accident in EN headings.

8) Validation gate before write (mandatory)
- If any uniqueness check fails, do not write files.
- Regenerate until all formats pass.
- Return pass/fail report per file with failed checks.

Same-persona multi-format diversification (mandatory):
- If one persona is used across multiple formats in the same batch, do not reuse the same core pain sentence across those formats.
- Build a per-format sub-angle map from Layer 1 + Layer 2 before writing copy, and lock one unique sub-angle per format.
- Allowed sub-angle sources:
  - Layer 1 pain point line
  - Layer 1 trigger scenario
  - Layer 1 objection
  - Layer 1 language-bank phrase
  - Layer 2 trust-anchor angle
- Sub-angle assignment rule for a 5-format batch using one persona:
  - HERO: primary pain contrast
  - BA: transition from one concrete trigger to one concrete recovery behavior
  - TEST: objection-to-belief shift (quote-style trust framing)
  - FEAT: mechanism breakdown mapped to a different trigger than HERO/BA
  - UGC: first-person micro-moment using a language-bank phrase not used in other formats
- Repetition block: do not reuse the same 2-4 word motif across more than one format in the batch (for example: `night loop`, `undoes your day`, `late-night cravings`).
- If motif overlap appears, regenerate the lower-priority format copy until all five formats are meaningfully distinct in angle, not just wording.

### Production write instruction:

- Keep `mode.write_enabled = true` in production.
- Update `mode.last_updated` on every successful append.
- Generate 1 variation per requested format unless user explicitly asks for more.
- Append entry before final handoff.

---

## 11) Format Specifications

Keep format structure fixed. Swap persona-specific headline/caption blocks.

### HERO
- Purpose: broad conversion
- Persona use: strongest pain-led hook + fastest believable outcome
- Copy shape: strong headline, one mechanism-to-outcome support line, CTA
- Text budget: 18-32 words
      - Minimum copy units: headline + 1 support line + CTA
      - HERO support-line rule: the support line must show how the approved mechanism supports weight loss / excess-weight reduction / obesity-reduction intent; it cannot be only a generic routine or mindset line
      - Preferred support-line pattern: mechanism -> weight-management outcome
      - Example direction only: "Helps control cravings so weight reduction feels easier to sustain."
      - Layout lock: headline in top text band only (top 15-32% of canvas), support directly below, CTA in lower safe band.

### BA
- Purpose: show transition from pain to control
- Persona use: "before" = persona struggle, "after" = first meaningful win
- Copy shape: pain-to-progress headline + 3 outcome bullets
- Text budget: 22-36 words
      - Minimum copy units: headline + 2-3 short bullets + CTA

### TEST
- Purpose: trust
- Persona use: testimonial language mirrors persona words (cravings, stuck, no time)
- Copy shape: quote + attribution + trust line + CTA
- Text budget: 24-40 words
      - Minimum copy units: headline/quote + attribution + trust line + CTA
- Testimonial integrity: never fabricate customer quotes; if real quote is unavailable, use rating + user-count + mechanism proof framing instead

### FEAT
- Purpose: mechanism clarity
- Persona use: map each feature to persona friction
- Copy shape: "what makes it work" + 3-4 benefit bullets + CTA
- Text budget: 26-42 words
      - Minimum copy units: headline + 3 feature-benefit bullets + CTA

### UGC
- Purpose: authenticity
- Persona use: first-person micro-story from persona POV
- Copy shape: my routine support + 3 practical wins + CTA
- Text budget: 16-26 words
      - Default text policy: headline (max 8 words) + support line (max 8 words) + CTA (max 4 words)
      - Minimum copy units: headline + 1 short support line + CTA
- No bullets or long paragraph quote unless explicitly requested

```

Add this mandatory line in every prompt:
- "Keep on-image text minimal and mobile-readable. Avoid dense copy blocks."

Add this mandatory line in every prompt:
- "Typography must be pin-sharp. If any text appears soft, blurry, or smeared, regenerate."

### Length floor:
- Full production prompt: 45-75 lines minimum for one format.
- If below 35 lines: treat as compressed and rewrite with full depth before sending.

### Prompt length hardline check (mandatory):
- Never collapse to ultra-short prompts after follow-ups.
- Final image prompt must retain full structure with all sections intact.
- Minimum required sections in every final prompt:
  1) Product Lock
  2) Output Spec
  3) Format Layout Instructions
  4) Persona Input
  5) Exact On-Image Copy
  6) Negative Constraints
  7) Quality Bar
  8) Visual Direction Block
  9) Typography Sharpness Block
- If any section is missing, treat as invalid and regenerate the prompt text before sending.
- Brevity is allowed only inside lines, not by dropping sections.

### Prompt compression prevention:
- Do not summarize or shorten the final generation prompt after follow-ups.
- On revisions: edit only the requested part, keep all other sections intact.
- Preserve all guardrail lines during rewrites.

### Language output mode:
- Always generate two final prompts together and save both in the batch folder:
  - English prompt
  - Hindi prompt
- Keep the same layout instructions in both, only language/copy changes.
- Language purity rule:
  - English output must be fully English (no Hinglish transliteration).
  - Hindi output must be fully Hindi in Devanagari script.
  - Do not mix scripts in one line unless explicitly requested.
- Image-generation default rule:
  - Send only EN prompt to Nano Banana API by default.
  - Do not submit HI prompt unless user explicitly asks.

### Text clarity and sharpness rule (mandatory):
- Prioritize crisp typography over decorative styling.
- Use high contrast text/background pairs.
- Keep text on flat areas; avoid curved, noisy, or low-contrast surfaces.
- Avoid perspective-warped text and ultra-thin font styles.
- Keep all text edge-sharp and mobile-legible at 100% view.

### Ad-factory prompt upgrades (adopted)
- Keep this explicit reference line in every final prompt: "Use provided product references as exact appearance truth for pack shape, label, and color."
- Enforce readability target: all visible copy must meet high contrast intent equivalent to WCAG AA readability.
- For testimonial creatives, never invent quotes; fallback to star rating + user count + concrete benefit when quote proof is unavailable.
- For scaled variants, vary one main axis at a time (headline angle, CTA, layout, or visual mood) to preserve test clarity.
- Keep output-ready sizing explicit per placement when requested: 1080x1350 (portrait default), 1080x1080 (feed square), 1080x1920 (stories).
- When generating batches, keep product fidelity constraints identical across all variants; only concept variables should change.

## 13) Full Production Prompt Template (filled example — copy and adapt)

PRODUCT LOCK BLOCK
- Use the uploaded Obesity Killer product packshot images as absolute visual truth.
- Do not redesign, redraw, relabel, or alter any product or packaging in any way.
- Do not change brand name, label colors, illustrations, proportions, or any text (Hindi or English).
- If any label text is unclear — preserve the original image as-is. Do not reinterpret it.
- Only permitted: placement, scaling, subtle drop shadows, mild warm lighting correction.

OUTPUT SPEC
- Canvas: 1080 x 1350 pixels. Portrait. 4:5 ratio.
- Style: [HERO / BA / TEST / FEAT / UGC] — polished enough for paid ad deployment.
- Text policy: Low-text by default. All copy minimal and mobile-readable at 375px width.
- Rendering: No compression artifacts. No soft edges on text or product label.
- All 5 products present, proportionally sized per reference dimensions, unmodified.
- Readability: maintain high-contrast foreground/background treatment for ad-platform legibility.
- Placement safety: before finalizing any prompt, lock all critical text, logos, CTA, and product-signaling elements inside the format-safe protected area.
- Default canvas mode when not specified by user: 4:5 portrait at 1080 x 1350.
- 4:5 safe-zone rule for mobile-first delivery: keep critical elements away from the top 14%, bottom 35%, and outer 6% side margins.
- 4:5 pixel guardrail at 1080 x 1350: avoid critical placements in the top 189px, bottom 473px, and outer 65px on left/right.
- 9:16 safe-zone rule for Stories/Reels delivery: keep critical text, logos, and CTA out of the top and bottom UI-risk bands and away from side edges.
- 9:16 pixel guardrail at 1080 x 1920: keep critical elements out of the top 250px, bottom 340px, and outer 65px on left/right unless the platform explicitly guarantees safe visibility.
- Size override rule: if channel-specific export is requested, output exact dimensions explicitly in prompt.

FORMAT LAYOUT INSTRUCTIONS
- [Fill based on selected format from Section 11]
- Composition: [describe zone map for selected format]
- Focal hierarchy: product dominant, text secondary, background tertiary.
- Product zone: [center / center-right / foreground-lower — specify per format]
- Text zones: flat uncluttered areas only — never over busy background detail.
- Text stack map (mandatory):
  - Headline zone = upper band only (top 15-32% of canvas).
  - Support line zone = directly below headline (top 32-45%).
  - CTA zone = lower safe band (bottom 70-85%), never above headline/support.
  - Forbidden placement = headline in lower-third or below product midline.
- 4:5 safe placement override:
  - Keep all essential text, CTA, logos, and product-signaling elements inside the center-safe region.
  - Do not place critical elements in the top 14%, bottom 35%, or outer 6% side margins.
  - Treat the lower 35-40% as a danger zone for CTA and key copy when the ad may run in reels/story-like surfaces with UI overlays.
- 9:16 safe placement override:
  - Keep all essential text, CTA, logos, and product-signaling elements inside the central protected zone only.
  - Do not place key elements in the top 250px, bottom 340px, or outer 65px on left/right of a 1080 x 1920 canvas.
  - Keep the bottom interaction zone visually quiet so platform UI does not collide with message-critical copy.
- Background: [reference selected background slot — see Section 9 below]
- Camera: [close-medium / medium / overhead — specify per format]
- Lighting: warm soft directional — source from top-left. Subtle drop shadows beneath products.
- Spacing: strong whitespace between zones. Grid-based alignment. Nothing floats randomly.

PERSONA INPUT BLOCK
- Persona: [Name from persona library]
- Pain: [what hurts now]
- Desire: [dream outcome]

VISUAL DIRECTION BLOCK
- Background slot: [BG-XXX — slot name] (selected from background variation engine using exhaustive format-wise rotation)
- Scene: [describe scene based on selected slot]

- Placement lock:
  - Headline must sit in the upper text band (top 15-32%).
  - Support line must sit directly under headline with consistent left alignment.

  - Never place headline below support or in lower-third.
- Forbidden: thin fonts, script fonts, decorative typefaces, glow effects, outlined text, drop shadows on copy
- Mandatory: crisp hard text edges — zero softness — zero anti-alias blur on any character
- If any text is soft, blurry, or illegible — discard and regenerate immediately

---

## 14) Language Output Rules

Always produce two final prompts together:
- English prompt (fully English — no Hinglish transliteration)
- Hindi prompt (fully Hindi in Devanagari script — no mixed scripts in one line unless explicitly requested)

Keep the same layout instructions in both. Only the copy block changes language.
For image generation, submit EN prompt only by default. Submit HI only on explicit request.

---

## 15) Interactive Ad Request Flow (assistant behavior)

Decision policy (mandatory):
- If user gives no specific inputs in first ad request, generate default starter batch immediately (no clarification round).
- Single-command behavior: when user says "create ads", run end-to-end in one flow: generate prompts -> save `output/vN/` -> submit API jobs (EN default) -> save images in `generated_image/vN/`.
- If user gives specific inputs (persona/headline/format), apply them directly.
- If user gives partial inputs, apply provided values and fill missing values with defaults.
- Ask follow-up questions only when user intent is conflicting (for example, two different persona instructions for same format).
- Never ask pre-flight questions like "text prompts or images?" for standard create-ad requests; default to end-to-end flow.
- If runtime blockers exist (missing API key, missing image URLs, API failure), still complete all non-blocked steps first (generate + save prompts), then report the exact blocker and stop only blocked steps.
- Do not narrate internal workflow steps (for example: "reading files", "extracting sections", "checking patterns"). Return only final outputs and blockers.

Read-scope rule for `create ads` (mandatory):
- Read only required sources: this playbook, `productinfomain.txt`, `faq.txt`, `PRODUCT_MECHANISM_V1.txt`, `PERSONA_DEEP_DIVE_01_05.txt`, `BACKGROUND_VARIANTS.JSON`, `background_variant.json`, `AD_GENERATION_REGISTRY.JSON`.
- Do not mine old `output/v*` prompt files for style or structure unless user explicitly asks to replicate a specific past batch.
- Historical checks must use registry indexes first; do not crawl old output folders by default.
- Forbidden sources for normal create-ad runs: `generated_image/v*/prompt_task_*.txt`, `generated_image/v*/task_*.json`, `generated_image/v*/batch_run_summary.json`.
- Forbidden behavior for normal create-ad runs: progress narration blocks like "Explored X files", "Read ...", and step-by-step planning chatter.
- Output contract: return only (a) files created/updated, (b) execution result, (c) blockers/errors with exact fix needed.

Input parsing rules:
- Persona input accepted as one value for all formats, or format-wise values.
- Headline input accepted as custom per format or one master line.
- Format input accepted as single or multiple from: HERO, BA, TEST, FEAT, UGC.
- If format is not provided, default to all 5 formats.

Defaults when missing:
- Headline mode default: AI-generated fresh headlines.
- Persona default: random selection from persona library (1-22), format-wise.
- Randomization rule: avoid repeating the same persona across formats in the same batch when possible.
- If registry history exists, avoid persona+format combinations that appear in the recent dedupe window.

Generation sequence:
Step 1 - Parse user-provided persona/headline/format values.
Step 2 - Fill missing fields from defaults.
Step 3 - Generate copy for requested formats.
Step 4 - Background slot selection.

Step 4 — Background slot selection
- Check registry for recently used slots per selected format.
- Select an unused slot automatically and state which one was selected.
- User may override by requesting a specific slot number.
- For catalog selection, read/update `indexes.slot_exhaustion_tracker.<FORMAT>` (used/remaining/cycle_number).

Step 4.25 — Safe-zone enforcement (mandatory)
- Every background must be treated as a *safe-zone controlled* scene: keep key subject and all important copy away from edge risk bands.
- Use the structured background catalog in `background_variant.json` (not `BACKGROUND_VARIANTS.JSON`) because it includes safe-zone control fields:
  - `composition`, `layout_intent`, `cta_safe_space`, `crop_safety`
- When you pick a background slot `BG-XXX`, generate a *seeded* background prompt so the safe-zone phrasing is deterministic per batch.
  - Selection order (mandatory):
    1) Pick an *unused* background slot for the requested format from `AD_GENERATION_REGISTRY.JSON` → `indexes.slot_exhaustion_tracker.<FORMAT>.remaining_slots_current_cycle` when present.
    2) If that list is empty/missing, pick a slot not in `indexes.backgrounds_by_format.<FORMAT>` recent window; if still not possible, fall back to any valid slot but state it explicitly.
  - Seed rule (mandatory, deterministic): `SEED = (BATCH_NUMBER * 1000) + (PERSONA_NUMBER * 10) + VARIATION`
    - Example: batch `v7`, persona `7`, variation `1` → seed `7071`
  - Use: `python3 scripts/upgrade_safezone_backgrounds.py --prompt-only --id BG-XXX --format 4:5 --seed <SEED>`
  - Mandatory script execution note:
    - Do not simulate this command. Run it and paste the real stdout sentence.
    - If the script errors, stop and fix; never continue with guessed seed text.
  - Paste the resulting *seeded* sentence into Section 8 (VISUAL DIRECTION BLOCK) and keep the selected `BG-XXX`.
  - Add a line in Section 8: `Seed: <SEED>` so reviewers can verify deterministic seeding was applied.
  - MANDATORY CHECKPOINT: Section 8 must contain the full OUTPUT of upgrade_safezone_backgrounds.py (seeded sentence), not just the seed number. If your prompt only says "Seed: <SEED>" without the seeded background sentence, it is INVALID — regenerate immediately.
  - ALSO: Extract and include these 4 safe-zone fields from background_variant.json into Section 8: composition, layout_intent, cta_safe_space, crop_safety. All 4 must be present in the final prompt.
  - Store both `BG-XXX` and `<SEED>` in the registry notes (or dedicated fields) so the background prompt can be reproduced later.
- Never “fix safe-zones after the fact” by rewriting the prompt mid-run; safe-zone rules must be present in the prompt *before* the API call.

Step 4.5 - Text dedupe gate (mandatory)
- Before finalizing output text, check registry `indexes.used_text` for headline/support/CTA/caption/bullets in both EN and HI.
- If any text string already exists in index, regenerate that text until unique.
- Never reuse any previously used text string.
- Near-duplicate guard (mandatory): reject copy that is structurally too similar to recent outputs even if exact words changed.
  - Reject if same first 4-token opening pattern appears in recent outputs for the same format/language.
  - Reject if headline/support skeleton matches a recent pattern with minimal lexical change.
  - Reject if 2 or more bullets reuse the same verb-led template as recent outputs in that format.
  - Reject if same-persona same-batch outputs reuse the same trigger scenario or objection source line across formats.
  - Reject if same-persona same-batch outputs share the same 2-4 word motif in headline/support across formats.
- Diversity tag gate (mandatory): assign and validate tags before finalizing text:
  - `opening_pattern_4tok_en` / `opening_pattern_4tok_hi`
  - `copy_skeleton`
  - `hook_structure_class`
  - `proof_style_class`
  - `cta_voice_class`
- If tag combination violates matrix or recent-window rules, regenerate copy and re-tag before proceeding.

Step 4.75 - Validation checklist gate (mandatory before writing `output/vN/*`)
- The generator must run this checklist and pass all checks before writing any `OUTPUT_<FORMAT>_<LANG>.txt` file.
- If any check fails, block write, report failed check IDs, regenerate/fix, then re-run checklist.
- Hard fail policy: if any `CHK-*` fails, do not write partial batch files. Regenerate until all prompts in the requested batch pass.

Validation checklist (machine-checkable):
- `CHK-01` sections_present: all 9 required sections exist (Section 1 through Section 9).
- `CHK-02` section_depth: each section meets minimum bullet/line depth defined in Section 12.
- `CHK-03` copy_units: required copy units exist for the format (headline/support-or-quote/CTA/bullets rules).
- `CHK-04` text_budget: on-image copy word count falls within format budget.
- `CHK-05` exact_text_uniqueness: no exact string reuse against `indexes.used_text`.
- `CHK-06` structural_uniqueness: near-duplicate guards pass (opening pattern, skeleton, bullet-template checks).
- `CHK-07` diversity_tags_present: all 5 diversity tags are assigned and valid.
- `CHK-08` diversity_matrix_pass: batch-level diversity constraints are still satisfied after this ad is added.
- `CHK-09` background_traceability: prompt contains `Background slot: BG-XXX`, `Seed: <SEED>`, seeded sentence, and all 4 safe-zone fields.
- `CHK-10` product_lock_lines: product lock block includes required fidelity constraints and absolute visual truth line.
- `CHK-11` language_purity: EN is fully English and HI is Devanagari-only unless mixed script is explicitly requested.
- `CHK-12` script_execution_evidence: when script-based steps are required, command output evidence exists (no simulated results).
- `CHK-13` symbol_hygiene: headline/support/CTA contain no banned decorative symbols (`*`, `-`, `_`, `|`, `~`, `#`, `@`, `/`, `\\`).
- `CHK-14` version_progression: write target is next available `vN` (max existing + 1), never overwrite existing batch folder.
- `CHK-15` registry_target_file: updates are applied to root `AD_GENERATION_REGISTRY.JSON` only; no alternate/new registry files created.
- `CHK-16` text_placement_hierarchy: headline in top band, support below headline, CTA in lower safe band; headline never in lower-third.
- `CHK-17` no_disclaimer_default: no Disclaimer line in on-image copy unless user explicitly requests disclaimer mode.
- `CHK-18` no_forbidden_source_scan: normal create-ad run does not read old generated-image task artifacts (`generated_image/v*/prompt_task_*.txt`, `task_*.json`, `batch_run_summary.json`).
- `CHK-19` no_progress_chatter: final response contains no internal exploration narration ("Explored", "Read", "I will now...").
- `CHK-20` fresh_composition_only: final copy is freshly composed from persona Layer 1 + Layer 2 and passes structural uniqueness checks.
- `CHK-21` same_persona_batch_angle_separation: when one persona appears in multiple formats in a batch, each format uses a distinct sub-angle source and passes motif non-repetition checks.
- `CHK-22` english_copy_no_hinglish: for `OUTPUT_*_EN.txt`, on-image copy fields (headline/support/quote/bullets/CTA/trust line/attribution) must not contain Hindi/romanized-Hindi phrasing.
- `CHK-23` no_workstation_props_default: unless explicitly requested, do not include workstation-heavy props (keyboard, laptop, monitor, mouse) in visual direction blocks.
- `CHK-24` support_line_outcome_anchor: support lines must not be generic routine-only language; they must connect approved mechanism logic to weight-loss / excess-weight / obesity-reduction intent using compliant wording.
- `CHK-25` safe_zone_rules_present: prompt must include the correct safe-zone rule set for the selected canvas ratio before write.
- `CHK-26` critical_elements_inside_safe_zone: headline, support line, CTA, logos, and product-signaling elements must stay out of declared top/bottom/side risk bands for 4:5 and 9:16 outputs.

Operational examples of CHK-22 failure (reject and regenerate):
- `Raat ko control nahi ho raha?`
- `Subah wale regret se mukt`
- `Try Karein`

Checklist result contract:
- Emit a compact status object per prompt: `{"status":"pass|fail","failed_checks":[...],"format":"...","language":"..."}`.
- Only `status=pass` prompts may be written to `output/vN/*`.

Step 5 — Final output and storage
- Deliver final prompts in both EN and HI for selected format(s).
- Compute next version before writing: scan `output/` for existing `vN` folders and set `N = max(existing) + 1`.
- Save prompts under `output/vN/` using that computed `N`.
- Never rewrite an older version folder when user asks "create ads".
- If user explicitly asks to reuse an existing `vN`, keep folder but write new files with `_V2`, `_V3`, etc.
- File naming per format/language/variation:
  - `OUTPUT_<FORMAT>_EN.txt`
  - `OUTPUT_<FORMAT>_HI.txt`
  - For multiple variations: `OUTPUT_<FORMAT>_EN_V2.txt` (and same pattern for HI)
- State the background slot used and log it to registry (`mode.write_enabled: true`).

Step 5.5 — Prompt assembly for API
- For each API job, build one complete prompt only:
  - Start with `input/startingprompt.txt`
  - Then append exactly one generated prompt file body
- Never merge multiple format prompts into one API call.
- Traceability: save the *composed* prompt (startingprompt + generated prompt) under `generated_image/vN/<format>-<language>/prompt_task_<taskId>.txt`.

Step 5.6 — API execution (Nano Banana 2 via Kie)
- Endpoint: `POST https://api.kie.ai/api/v1/jobs/createTask`
- Auth: `Authorization: Bearer <KIE_API_KEY>`
- API key source priority:
  - First read `KIE_API_KEY` from shell environment.
  - If not present, load it from `scripts/.env`.
  - Expected format in `scripts/.env`: `KIE_API_KEY=your_key_here`
- Model: `nano-banana-2`
- Images source for API: read URLs from `input/activeimages.txt` (one URL per line, max 14)
- Keep `input/passiveimage.txt` for fallback inventory only (do not use by default)
- Default generation settings: `resolution=2K`, `aspect_ratio=4:5`, `output_format=png`
- Submit one job per prompt file (EN by default).
- Poll task state via `GET /api/v1/jobs/recordInfo?taskId=...` until `success` or `fail`.
- Mandatory script execution note:
  - If running `scripts/kie_nano_batch.py`, execute it for real and rely on actual API responses.
  - Never claim submission/poll/download success without task IDs and saved file paths from command output.

Step 5.7 — Generated image storage
- Save results in `generated_image/vN/<format>-<language>/`
- Examples:
  - `generated_image/v1/feat-en/`
  - `generated_image/v2/hero-en/`
- Keep task metadata JSON in same folder for traceability (`task_<taskId>.json`).
- Also keep the composed prompt file in the same folder (`prompt_task_<taskId>.txt`).

Step 6 - Registry write (mandatory in production)
- Registry file handling rule (mandatory):
  - Always read and update root `AD_GENERATION_REGISTRY.JSON`.
  - "Create registry" means initialize missing keys in this file, not creating a new registry file.
  - Do not create alternate names like `AD_GENERATION_REGISTRY_V2.JSON`, `registry.json`, or per-run registry files.
  - If file exists, perform read-modify-append only; never reset `entries`.
- Append full entry to `entries`.
- Append `{entry_id, timestamp, background_slot, background_source}` to `indexes.backgrounds_by_format.<FORMAT>`.
- If background_source is `catalog`, update `indexes.slot_exhaustion_tracker.<FORMAT>` for cycle progression.
- Append every used text string to `indexes.used_text` buckets.
- Append diversity tags to `indexes.copy_patterns` buckets (`recent_opening_4tok`, `recent_skeletons`, `recent_cta_voice`, `recent_hook_structure`, `recent_proof_style`).
- Keep append-only behavior; do not delete or rewrite past records.

Generated image task logging (mandatory):
- Every `task_<taskId>.json` and `batch_run_summary.json` job record must include prompt metadata:
  - `persona_name`
  - `persona_number`
  - `background_slot`
  - `background_title` (if available)
  - `seed`
  - `seeded_background_prompt`
  - `headline`
  - `support_line`
  - `cta`
- Missing any of the above should be treated as logging failure and fixed before final handoff.

Default behavior if user gives minimal input:
- Generate default starter batch immediately using Section 0 defaults.
- Use AI-generated fresh headlines.
- Use all 5 formats unless user narrowed scope.

Prompt quality upgrade block (add by default):
- "Typography must be pin-sharp. If any text appears soft, blurry, or smeared, regenerate."
- "Keep text count minimal and increase font size rather than packing more copy."
- "Use clean sans typography with strong stroke clarity; no thin/light weights for body text."
- "Use Poppins only for on-image text: Headline in Poppins Bold, support/CTA in Poppins Medium or Regular."

Mandatory visual-direction block (add by default):
- "Describe scene, subject, and props explicitly (what is visible in frame)."
- "Define camera framing (close/medium/wide), angle, and product placement zone."
- "Define lighting style (soft daylight/warm indoor), shadow direction, and contrast level."
- "Define background behavior (clean, low-noise, non-distracting, premium texture)."
- "Define realism constraints (natural skin, correct hand anatomy, true-to-life proportions)."
- "Define what to avoid visually (stock-template look, clutter, random stickers, noisy overlays)."

## 16) Quality Guardrails

Reject and regenerate if any one fails:
- Text not fully readable
- Text appears blurry, soft, or smeared
- Product label modified in any way
- Generic template look
- Anatomy issues (for UGC hands)
- Cluttered layout or low hierarchy
- High text density on canvas

## 16A) Text budget guardrails (to prevent clutter)

Use strict on-canvas text budgets.

Balance rule:
- Text-light is required. Text-empty is not acceptable.
- Every ad must communicate offer + mechanism/proof + action, not just a headline.

Global rules:
- Never place paragraph captions on-image unless user explicitly asks.
- Prefer short headline + short support line + CTA.

- If bilingual is needed, generate separate EN and HI creatives (no mixed-language text in one creative).

Recommended on-image text limits by format:
- HERO: 18-32 words
- BA: 22-36 words
- TEST: 24-40 words
- FEAT: 26-42 words
- UGC: 16-26 words

Minimum required on-image copy units by format:
- HERO: headline + 1 support line + CTA
- BA: headline + 2-3 short bullets + CTA
- TEST: headline/quote + attribution + trust line + CTA
- FEAT: headline + 3 feature-benefit bullets + CTA
- UGC: headline + 1 short support line + CTA

UGC default text policy:
- One headline (max 8 words)
- One short support line (max 8 words)
- One CTA (max 4 words)
- No bullets or long paragraph quote unless requested

Text budget repair commands:

If output is too empty:
- "Keep same visual concept, add one concise support line and one trust/proof line while preserving clean spacing and readability."

If output is copy-heavy:
- "Regenerate same concept with minimal text: remove paragraphs and bullets; keep only headline and CTA. Maintain product fidelity and composition."

Visual quality repair commands:

- "Keep same layout, improve text sharpness and hierarchy only."
- "Keep same composition, restore exact product packaging from uploaded references."
- "Keep concept, reduce clutter and increase premium spacing."
- "Regenerate with crisp text edges, higher contrast, larger font sizes, and fewer words on canvas."

## 16B) Visual specificity guardrails (to improve image quality)

If image quality feels generic or under-directed, increase visual specificity in prompts.

Always specify these fields:
- Scene context: room type, time of day, mood
- Subject profile: age band, role context, expression, pose
- Product placement: hand-held / table-top / foreground-right / centered-lower
- Camera: lens feel (phone-like vs editorial), crop, perspective
- Lighting: source direction, softness, color temperature
- Material cues: tabletop texture, wall texture, fabric realism
- Depth: foreground-midground-background separation
- Brand palette usage: where accent colors appear and where they should not

Hard reject conditions:
- Subject looks stock-photo generic
- Product visually competes with busy background
- Scene lacks narrative cue for selected persona
- Composition has no clear focal hierarchy

## 16C) Prompt compression prevention

Goal: stop quality drift from prompt shortening across turns.

Rules:
- Do not summarize the final generation prompt unless user explicitly asks for a short version.
- Keep technical constraints explicit even in later iterations.
- On revisions, edit only the requested part and keep the rest of the full prompt unchanged.
- Preserve all guardrail lines during rewrites (product fidelity, text budget, sharpness, negative constraints).
- Preserve per-section depth minimums during rewrites.

Optional delivery mode:
- Provide two blocks when needed:
  - Full Production Prompt (default)
  - Short Operator Note (optional)
- The image model should always receive the Full Production Prompt.

Quick repair prompts:
- "Keep same layout, improve text sharpness and hierarchy only."
- "Keep same composition, restore exact product packaging from references."
- "Keep concept, reduce clutter and increase premium spacing."
- "Regenerate with crisp text edges, higher contrast, larger font sizes, and fewer words on canvas."

## 17) Compliance and Trust Notes

- Avoid fear tactics and fake urgency.
- Losing a sale is better than losing trust.

## 18) New Chat Setup (copy-paste starter)

Paste this in every fresh chat:

```
You are generating static ad creatives for Obesity Killer Kit.
Follow these rules strictly:

- Use only claims from my knowledge base (productinfo).
- Never invent mechanisms, results, or medical claims.
- Use uploaded Obesity Killer product packshot images as absolute visual truth. I will upload 6 images each session.
- Create ads in 5 formats: HERO, BA, TEST, FEAT, UGC.
- For each ad, use one persona input block (pain, desire, friction, proof needed, tone cue).
- If the persona is covered in `PERSONA_DEEP_DIVE_01_05.txt`, also use that file for objections, trigger moments, mirrored phrases, mechanism framing, and trust selection.
- If the persona is covered in `PERSONA_DEEP_DIVE_01_05.txt`, generate final copy through the 2-layer workflow: raw truth -> strategy -> fresh target-language copy.
- Headline must do two things: scroll stop + pain-solution fit.
- Caption must increase Value = (Dream Outcome x Likelihood) / (Time Delay x Sacrifice).
- Keep language simple, active, specific, and short.
- Reject generic templates; prioritize clear hierarchy and premium composition.
- Default production output: 1 variation per format.
- Always provide English + Hindi versions of final prompts and save them in `output/vN/`.
- Use plain conversational punctuation in on-image copy. Do not use decorative symbols like `*`, `-`, `_`, `|`, `~`, `#`, `@`, `/`, `\\` in headline/support/CTA.
- Do not add disclaimer lines on-image unless I explicitly ask for disclaimer mode.
- Never rely on fixed headline banks; generate fresh headlines each request.
- Keep typography pin-sharp; regenerate if any on-image text is blurry.
- Use Poppins font family for all on-image text (Headline: Poppins Bold; body/support/CTA: Poppins Medium or Regular).
- Select a background slot from the Background Variation Engine (Section 9 of playbook) using exhaustive format-wise rotation (no repeat until all allowed slots for that format are used once). State which slot you selected.
- Enforce strict text uniqueness: headline/support/CTA/caption/bullets in EN and HI must never repeat any previously used string.
- Check the registry at `AD_GENERATION_REGISTRY.JSON` before generation to avoid persona, angle, and background repetition.
- Registry is in production mode. Write one entry after each generation.
- When user says "create ads", write to next available `output/vN/` (max existing + 1). Never overwrite old version folders.
- "Create registry" or "update registry" must target existing root `AD_GENERATION_REGISTRY.JSON` only.
```

Optional add-on line:
```
When I ask for ad creation with no specific inputs, generate the default starter batch directly (no clarification round). If I provide persona/headline/format, apply those inputs directly.
```

---

## 19) Practical Day-to-Day Usage

1. Open this playbook and copy the New Chat Setup block (Section 18).
2. Paste it in a fresh Gemini or assistant chat.
3. Upload all 6 product packshot images to Gemini Web.
4. Start with: "Create ad."
5. If no inputs are provided, generate default starter batch immediately.
6. If partial/specific inputs are provided, apply them and fill missing fields from defaults.
7. Save generated prompts in `output/vN/` and run API jobs (EN by default) using links from `input/activeimages.txt`.
8. Store generated images in `generated_image/vN/<format>-en/` (or `-hi` only when requested).
9. Use repair commands (Section 16) if quality fails.
10. In production (`mode.write_enabled: true`), append each generation to `entries` and update indexes.

How to avoid repetition at scale:
- Never reuse old text directly (headline, support line, CTA, caption, bullets).
- Recompute all copy every generation from persona fields and approved claims.
- Use registry for both angle-level dedupe and strict text-level dedupe.
- Rotate catalog background slots with exhaustive format-wise cycles (no repeat until pool exhaustion, then reset cycle).

## 20) Registry File — Current State

File path: `AD_GENERATION_REGISTRY.JSON`

Current mode: production (`mode.write_enabled: true`)

Starting state example (append entries in live production):

```json
{
  "mode": {
    "phase": "production",
    "write_enabled": true,
    "last_updated": null
  },
  "entries": [],
  "indexes": {
    "backgrounds_by_format": {},
    "slot_exhaustion_tracker": {},
    "used_text": {},
    "copy_patterns": {
      "by_format_language": {},
      "recent_opening_4tok": {},
      "recent_skeletons": {},
      "recent_cta_voice": {},
      "recent_hook_structure": {},
      "recent_proof_style": {}
    }
  }
}
```

Registry indexing requirement (production):
- Maintain `indexes.backgrounds_by_format` for per-format background tracking.
- Maintain `indexes.slot_exhaustion_tracker` for catalog cycle state per format.
- Maintain `indexes.used_text` for global text uniqueness tracking.
- Maintain `indexes.copy_patterns` for structural diversity tracking (opening patterns, skeletons, hook/proof/CTA classes).
- Treat every string in `indexes.used_text` as permanently blocked from reuse.

Production live rules:
- Keep `mode.write_enabled` true.
- Set `mode.last_updated` to current timestamp on every write.
- Append one entry per generation to `entries`.
- Never overwrite existing entries — append only.
- Read registry before every generation to check deduplication rules.
